      <h2>Scratch</h2>
      <p><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/436938439/">Bat Game</a></p>
      <p>When creating our websites, we were given the task of including our scratch game into our websites. When I tried to log into my account that I had made previously, I could not seem to log in. So, because of that I decided to creat a new game. This game make's you start as a bat on one side of the screen that has the goal to make it to the other side of the screen to eat a butterfly, avoiding obsitcals along the way.</p>

      <h2>Group Python Project</h2>
      <p><a href="https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/sharing/fireBrickBird5519">Group Picture</a></p>
      <p>In our AP Computer Science class, my group and I were given the task to make an image together coded in python that represented each of us. For my part of the project (far right) I decided to make a soccer field with a nice sky in the background.</p>

      <h2>Genius Hour</h2>
      <p><a href="https://www.typing.com/">Typing Practice</a></p>
      <p>In our CS class we were given the task to complete an hour of an educational topic of our choice. I decided to do typing practice to improve my skills as a typer and to help with my coding, since typing is such a big part of it. It lets you choose how difficult the lessons were and what topics you wanted to practice, telling you different things to type along the way.</p>
